# Building Ice for Python on Windows

This document describes how to build and install Ice for Python from source code
on Windows. If you prefer, you can also download [binary distributions][1] for
the supported platforms.

## Python Build Requirements

### Operating Systems and Compilers

Ice for Python is expected to build and run properly on Windows and was
extensively tested using the operating systems and compiler versions listed for
our [supported platforms][2].

The build requires the [Ice Builder for Visual Studio][8]. You must install
version 4.3.6 or greater to build Ice.

### Python Versions

Ice for Python supports Python versions 2.7 or 3.6. Note however that your
Python installation must have been built with a C++ compiler that is compatible
with the one used to build Ice for C++.

## Building the Python Extension

The Python interpreter is readily available on Windows platforms. You can build
it yourself using Microsoft Visual C++, or obtain a binary distribution from the
Python web site. The Python 3.6.x binary distribution is compiled with Visual
C++ 14, while Python 2.7.x is compiled with Visual C++ 10. You should compile the
Ice extension with the same Visual C++ version as your Python binary distribution.

Open a Visual Studio command prompt. For example, with Visual Studio 2015, you
can open one of:

- VS2015 x86 Native Tools Command Prompt
- VS2015 x64 Native Tools Command Prompt

Using the first Command Prompt produces `Win32` binaries by default, while 
the second Command Promt produces `x64` binaries by default.

In the Command Prompt, change to the `python` subdirectory:

    > cd python

You must build Ice for C++ from the `cpp` subdirectory. If you have not done so,
refer to the [C++ build instructions](../cpp/BuildInstructionsWindows.md).

Build the extension:

    > msbuild msbuild\ice.proj

This builds the extension with `Release` binaries for the default platform.
The extension will be placed in `python\x64\Release\IcePy.pyd` for the `x64` platform
and `python\Win32\Release\IcePy.pyd` for the `Win32` platform.

If you want to build a debug version of the extension, you can do so by setting
the MSBuild `Configuration` property to `Debug`:

    > msbuild msbuild\ice.proj /p:Configuration=Debug

The debug version of the extension will be placed in `python\x64\Debug\IcePy_d.pyd`
for the `x64` platform and `python\Win32\Debug\IcePy_d.pyd` for the `Win32` platform.

> *For Debug builds a debug version of the Python interpreter must be installed.*

If you want to build the extension for a different platform than the Command Prompt's
default platform, you need to set the MSBuild property `Platform`. The supported
values for this property are `Win32` and `x64`.

The following command builds the `x64` platform binaries with the `Release` configuration:

  > msbuild msbuild\ice.proj /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64

This command builds the `Win32` platform binaries with the `Release` configuration:

  > msbuild msbuild\ice.proj /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=Win32

> *When using the MSBuild Platform property, the build platform doesn't depend on
the command prompt's default platform.*

The build will use the default location for Python defined in
`python\msbuild\ice.props`. You can override it by setting the `PythonHome`
MSBuild property. For example, the following command will use Python installation
from `C:\Python36-AMD64` instead of the default location:

    > msbuild msbuild\ice.proj /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64 /p:PythonHome=C:\Python36-AMD64

## Configuring your Environment for Python

Modify your environment to allow Python to find the Ice extension for Python.
The interpreter must be able to locate the extension DLL as well as the Python
source files in the `python` subdirectory. This is normally accomplished by
setting the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to contain the necessary
subdirectory. For example, if the Ice for Python extension is installed in
`C:\Ice`, you could configure your environment as follows:

    > set PYTHONPATH=C:\Ice\python;C:\Ice\python\Win32\Release

## Running the Python Tests

After a successful build, you can run the tests as follows:

    $ python allTests.py --mode=Release --x86

If everything worked out, you should see lots of `ok` messages. In case of a
failure, the tests abort with `failed`.
